Description: This code attempts to classify locust olfactory response to two types of odors, Hexanol(pink) and Benzaldehyde(blue). The Perceptron classifier(a.k.a "filter" in code) is trained on two sets of responses from pink and blue stimuli, respectively. Then, it predicts the response to a new set of pink and blue stimuli. The accuracy comparisons of each prediction are plotted.

Instructions: You will need MATLAB. Run "Perceptron.m" to see results. Place the accompanying "Data.mat" within the same directory, because the script will load in this data at runtime. Make sure to have the Curve Fitting and Signal Processing toolboxes installed.
